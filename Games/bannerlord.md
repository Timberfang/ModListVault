	1. For Steam Workshop mods, skip to step 4. For other mods, continue to step 2.
	2. Locate your game installation folder. This can vary depending on the store the game was purchased from, but for Steam, it's located in `{Steam Library}\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord`.
		1. If you have the default Steam library folder, this path would be `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord`.
	3. In your game installation folder, extract the mod if it's a compressed folder, like a `.zip` file or `.rar` file.  Copy the mod folder into the `modules` subfolder of your installation folder.
	4. Launch the game. In the launcher, go to the "mods" tab at the top, under the word "Singleplayer". Click the box on the left side of the mod's name to enable it - a full square is enabled, a hollow square is disabled.
	5. If the mod load order needs to be changed, you can drag and drop mods in this list to adjust the load order. Mods higher in the list are loaded earlier, so mods that require other mods need their dependencies to be higher in the list.
