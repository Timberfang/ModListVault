# ModListVault

A hub of my personal mod lists for various games.

## Overview

This repository serves as documentation for my own use and possibly for the benefit of others as well. Here, I aim to list the mods I use for various games, where to get these mods, and how to install them. The largest (and very WIP) projects of this are my mod lists for the Elder Scrolls series, but I have smaller lists for other games as well. Common features in these lists include:

- **"Vanilla +":** Generally, I try to keep my mod lists relatively faithful to the original game. Large-scale overhauls or drastic departures from the base game are rarely included unless I feel very strongly about them. However, there are a few exceptions, listed below.
- **Furry Content:** I will admit; As a furry myself, I like having game mods that introduce or support furry content. If you do not want this content, it will usually be marked in its own section, which you can simply exclude. If there are exceptions to this policy, they will be listed in the mod list in question.
- **Small Lists:** I prefer simple lists to complex ones. When possible, I will prefer smaller or lighter mods to heavier ones, and oveall mod lists tend to be relatively short. The Elder Scrolls is a bit of an excepiton - as my favorite game series, there's a lot of small things I like to consider to make the game its best. However, these lists will usually be on the smaller side relative to other lists for these games.
- **Install Instructions:** Installation instructions will be included. If most or all mods for the game are installed in the same way, they will receive a general note at the top, but any mods that require special procedures will have their own instructions listed as well.

## Install Instructions

1. [Steam Workshop](./Install/SteamWorkshop.md): This covers how to download Steam Workshop items. If you own the game on Steam, this should be an easy process. If you don't, it *may* still be possible, but it depends on the game.
2. [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/): You'll need to make an account to download these mods. But for many games, including The Elder Scrolls series, Stardew Valley, Baldur's Gate 3, and The Witcher series, this is a large source of mods. As a third-party site independent of any game store, these should work in similar ways across any version of a game that can accept mods.

## Xbox Game Pass & Microsoft Store Games

If a game was downloaded through either Xbox Game Pass or the Microsoft Store, you will probably *not* be able to mod it. Microsoft has locked down the files of these games, and they are not easily user-modifiable. Versions from most other stores (e.g., Steam, GOG, Epic Games, Itch.io, etc.) should work well, though.

## Buying Games

You'll need to buy the game before you can mod it. I like [GOG](https://gog.com) for most games (Most games on GOG are DRM free, with offline installers available), but [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) is probably the most popular game store out there - I use it if the game isn't available on GOG, or if I need workshop support or other Steam features. Finally, I recommend checking [IsThereAnyDeal](https://isthereanydeal.com/) for sales on games if you want the best price.
