## Game Owned on Steam (Easier)

- For games you own on steam, installing Steam Workshop content is easy. For example, let's use the mod [Calamity Texture Pack](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2445323408) resource pack for Terraria. If you own Terraria on Steam, just click the green "Subscribe" button, and, assuming you're logged in, the resource pack will be installed automatically.

## Game Owned on Another Platform (Harder)

1. If you do *not* own the game on Steam, but you *do* own the game on another platform, like [GOG](https://gog.com), this is a little harder. **This process will not work for every game.**
2. First, we need to find the Workshop item, just like before. Again, we'll use the [Calamity Texture Pack](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2445323408) for Terraria. I personally own the game on GOG, but any PC version should work for this.
3. Take the link to the workshop item, go to the [Steam Workshop Downloader](https://steamworkshopdownloader.io/), and paste the link there in the central text field.
	- If the site warns that it "Probably requires login with an account that owns the game", this is a sign that it *may* not work, but it's still worth trying - in Terraria's case, it appears to work regardless.
4. If you *don't* know what SteamCMD is, click the red "no" button that appears after you paste the link. Follow the onscreen instructions to install the Steam Console Client, and then click the green "Continue" button at the bottom. If you *do* know how to use SteamCMD, click the green "yes" button.
5. Double-click on `steamcmd.exe`. If you're not already logged in, type `login anonymous` and press enter.
6. Continue in the Steam Workshop Downloader website's instructions. Copy the command it gives you, paste it into the SteamCMD terminal, and then press enter to download the Workshop item.
7. As the website indicates, if SteamCMD gives `ERROR! Download item ... failed (Failure).`, you need to buy the game in Steam to use the Workshop.
8. If the download succeeds, you can install the downloaded mod/resource files. How to install these varies from game-to-game, so you'll need to look up the installation instructions from there.
